    "DESCRIPTION": "I am currently retraining as a software developer and truly enjoy programming. I originally come from the automotive industry, where I especially liked troubleshooting and finding practical solutions. This structured way of thinking now helps me a lot in IT. I am learning new technologies step by step and enjoy continuously expanding my knowledge. If something doesn’t work right away, I stay persistent and keep working on it until I find a solution. I am highly motivated and look forward to growing both professionally and personally.",
